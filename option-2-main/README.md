## This is a 2 column website using CSS Grids

The parent container has class called "grid" and this in the media query:

.grid{

      display: grid;
      
      grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
      
      grid-column-gap: 50px;
      
  }
  
  There is a hamburger menu in the same horizontal space as the Name of the company. 
  You can change this so the company name is above or below the navegation. You will need to uncomment things and delete what you do not want.
