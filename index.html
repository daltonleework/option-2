					<h2>Welcome to The Ancient Collection</h2>

					<p>Monkeys are intelligent animals with complex behavioral and social needs. Companionship, group living, appropriate space, and an enriched environment are all important for their physiological, behavioral, and psychological health. The focus of animal care at the primate sanctuary is to provide conditions in which the captive populations of macaques, baboons, and vervet species are allowed to live out the remainder of their lives with extensive freedom of movement, choice of food, and choice of companions in accordance with their social nature.</p>

					<h2>Header type 2</h2>
					<p>We aim to provide a lifelong, high standard of care without being needlessly intrusive. Our facility is unique among U.S. sanctuaries in that it is one of the very few to provide large free-ranging environments that allow the majority of the monkeys to live as natural a life as possible with a minimal amount of human interference. Our sanctuary has remained nonprofit since its establishment in 1996.</p>

					<p>Sadly, one of the biggest reasons people are less likely to think that chimpanzees and orangutans are endangered is because they see them so often in movies and TV. According to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, “Dressing apes in human clothing, or training them to engage in unnatural (usually human) behaviors, while entertaining to some, inaccurately portrays their biology and conservation status. Since conservation efforts rely on informed public opinion, these practices serve to undermine communications vital to achieving conservation.” Great apes used in entertainment are most often babies or juveniles. Infant apes are used because adolescent and adult orangutans and chimpanzees are too strong and unmanageable, and therefore too dangerous to work around the public or around actors on sets. Many of the great apes that reside at The Ancient Collection have been retired from the entertainment industry.</p>

					<p>These iconic birds are very popular pets, and many are captured to supply demand for this trade. They are also familiar commercial mascots known for hawking stout, cereal, and other products. Indigenous peoples regard the bird with a more sacred eye; they are traditionally seen as conduits between the worlds of the living and the spirits.</p>
